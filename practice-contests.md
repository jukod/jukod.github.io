# Upcoming practice contests

Adrian and Calle are responsible for having the contests set up on Kattis.
They'll somehow keep a database of people who are registered in JU Kod
and add them weekly to the contest.
Some other info:

* Contests run from Monday 13:00 to Monday 13:00 every week.
* Lightweight contests: just 3-4 problems are enough for each week.
* Remember to always include a trivial problem.
* Announce results and new contest on Discord and on the mailing list.
  (maybe have the Discord bot do this)
