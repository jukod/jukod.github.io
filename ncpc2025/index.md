We will set up tables like this ideally the day before.

Again, computers will not be provided:
teams are expected to bring their own laptops.


## The NCPC

The [Nordic Collegiate Programming Contest (NCPC)][] is held every year.
Teams of 3 university students compete
solving [‚âà 10 programming problems][] in 5 hours
using either C, Python, Java, C#, C++, Haskell
or one of [40 other programming languages][].
At the end,
the team with [most solved problems][] wins.
It's quite fun!  :-)


### Preparing/practicing for the NCPC

The best problems for practicing leading up to the competition
are the
[problems from NCPC 2023](https://open.kattis.com/problem-sources/Nordic%20Collegiate%20Programming%20Contest%20%28NCPC%29%202023?order=difficulty_data),
[NCPC 2022](https://open.kattis.com/problem-sources/Nordic%20Collegiate%20Programming%20Contest%20%28NCPC%29%202022?order=difficulty_data) and
