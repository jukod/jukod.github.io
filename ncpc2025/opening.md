Problems usually involve standard IO in the command line:

* read from the keyboard and
* write to the screen.

------

Equipment:

* __1 computer per team__ with 1 keyboard, 1 mouse and 1 screen;
* no other electronic devices such as mobile phones;
* printed material is allowed (e.g.: books).

------

What you may and may not use:

* You may __NOT__ use the internet for anything other than accessing the contest page and documentation.
* You may __NOT__ use a program using generative AI, such as Github Copilot or ChatGPT.
* You may use prewritten code, and other software available on your computer that doesn‚Äôt break the previous two rules.
* You may __NOT__ communicate with anyone other than the contest organizers and your own team members.

------

For instance:

If you are using VS Code,
please remember to disable Copilot or any extensions with Generative AI.

------

You will get a printed copy of the problem statement in a sealed envelope.

Please only open it once the competition timer starts.

## Tips

* problems are not ordered by difficulty:
	- try to find and start with something easy
* the scoreboard shows all teams' progress:
	- look for problems that have been solved by several teams
* with 1h left, the scoreboard freezes and you can only see your own team progress
* problem scores are 0/1 (all-or-nothing):
	- try to think about edge cases if you get "wrong answer"

------

The contest uses the Kattis automatic judging system.
