Problems usually involve standard IO in the command line:

* read from the keyboard and
* write to the screen.


#### Rules

These are the [NCPC rules][ncpc-rules].

Equipment:

* __1 computer per team__ with 1 keyboard, 1 mouse and 1 screen;
* no other electronic devices such as mobile phones;
* printed material is allowed (e.g.: books).

What you may and may not use:

* You may __NOT__ use the internet for anything other than accessing the contest page and documentation.
* You may __NOT__ use a program using generative AI, such as Github Copilot or ChatGPT.
* You may use prewritten code, and other software available on your computer that doesn’t break the previous two rules.
* You may __NOT__ communicate with anyone other than the contest organizers and your own team members.

For instance:

If you are using VS Code,
please remember to disable Copilot or any extensions with Generative AI.


#### Additional rules

The above rules are a copy of [NCPC's rules][ncpc-rules].
In the practice workshop we have the following additional rules:

* 🎓 __Tutoring.__  Help from lecturers will be provided then.
* ♻️ __No solution re-use.__
  If the contest has a problem
  that you have solved already in previous practice,
  you need to re-solve it from scratch,
  preferably with a different team "driver" at the keyboard.
* 🛑 People arriving after 13:15 __may not__ be allowed in
