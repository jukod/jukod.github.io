The [Nordic Collegiate Programming Contest (NCPC)][NCPC] is held every year.
Teams of 3 university students compete
solving [≈ 10 programming problems][25pdf] in 5 hours
using C, Python, Java, C#, C++
or one of 40 other programming languages.
At the end,
the team with [most solved problems][25sb] wins.
It's quite fun!  :-)

![NCPC 2025 at JU](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0138649e-1ae2-4e77-b6f3-29c6b4d23c43)

In Sweden, we have participation of teams from several institutions,
including:
Chalmers,
Lund University,
KTH,
Linköping University,
Umeå University,
Karlstad University
and
our very own __Jönköping University__.

JU has participated since 2022,
and has got improved results and participation each year:

| NCPC Edition      | #-solved&nbsp;ps. | 🇸🇪-rank     | 🇸🇪%   | rank            | %           |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| [NCPC 2023][23sb] | 5 🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈      |    24th / 36  | top 66% |  89th / 160     | top 55%     |
| [NCPC 2024][24sb] | 4 🎈🎈🎈🎈        | __9th__ / 23  | top 40% |  __39th / 139__ | __top 30%__ |
| [NCPC 2025][25sb] | 5 🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈      | __13th__ / 49 | top 27% |  __41th / 173__ | __top 25%__ |

In 2025,
our best scoring team solved placed [13th (out of 49) in Sweden][25sb]
and [41st (out of 173) across the Nordics][25sbn].
This places us at the 25%,
competing head-to-head and toe-to-toe with teams from
other Swedish universities such as Chalmers, KTH, LiU, etc.
See [the scoreboard][25sb] for details.

The competition is held simultaneously at multiple locations ("sites"),
with a shared online scoreboard.
Teams generally compete at their own university when a site is available.
JU hosted a site in 2025 and
we have plans to do this again in the upcoming years.
Having a site made it so that we had more participation from students.
In 2025, we had __10 teams with 30 students total__!

| [NCPC] Edition    | #-teams                 | #-students |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ---------- |
| [NCPC 2023][23sb] |  1 👥                   | 3          |
| [NCPC 2024][24sb] |  4 👥👥👥👥             | 11         |
| [NCPC 2025][25sb] | 10 👥👥👥👥👥👥👥👥👥👥 | 30         |

Qualifying teams from the [NCPC] get to participate in the [NWERC],
the Northwestern Europe Regional (Programming) Contest.
A team from JU qualified and participated
in NWERC 2024 at the Netherlands and
in NWERC 2025 in Germany with nice results:

| [NWERC] Edition         | #-solved&nbsp;ps.        | rank       | %       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------- | ------- |
| [NWERC 2024][nwerc24sb] | 3 🎈🎈🎈 out of 13       | 69th / 80  | top 90% |
| [NWERC 2025][nwerc25sb] | 6 🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈 out of 12 | 83rd / 141 | top 60% |

In 2025, we got results matching the ones of UCL, Umeå or KTH for example.

Our best-scoring teams are set to participate in NCPC and hopefully NWERC again
in 2026,
so we hope to keep improving our results for 2026 and beyond.


### NCPC Costs, 33000 kr in 2026

The department of computing has reserved some time of two teachers
for organizing the competition itself
as well as
practice sessions for students throughout the year.

The estimated costs for NCPC and NWERC 2026 are:

* Hosting NCPC site here at JU: __8000 kr__
* Attending NWERC (with 1 team): __25000 kr__
* Total: __33000 kr__

With more funding we could for example send 2 teams to NWERC:
that would double our chances of improving our results
and qualifying to the next stage: the EUC, the European finals.

NCPC hosting costs are mainly food (light lunch)
and minor costs in office material.
NWERC costs are mainly transport
and accomodation: flight, train, bus and hotel.
There are no registration fees in either event.
