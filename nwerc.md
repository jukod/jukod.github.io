Practicing for the NWERC
========================

If you qualify for the NWERC,
it is time to take a look at NWERC problems from past years.
Here they are:
[NWERC 2022];
[NWERC 2021];
[NWERC 2020];
[NWERC 2019];
[NWERC 2018];
[NWERC 2017].

A good place to start is the N easiest problems from the (N+1) previous years for N = {1, 2, 3, ...}.  For N=1:
